Assignment 5: Personal Webpage Showcase
(AI-Integrated Version)

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

Create a personal webpage that showcases your skills, interests, and accomplishments. The webpage should be visually appealing, informative, and demonstrate your proficiency in HTML, CSS, and basic web design. You will also practice AI-assisted development using tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor while maintaining critical oversight and reflection.

This assignment emphasizes both technical competence and responsible use of AI tools in modern software development.

## Step 1: Planning

Before coding, plan your personal webpage.

- Purpose: What is the main purpose of your webpage? (Portfolio, resume, blog, or combination?)
- Content: What information will you include? (Bio, resume, projects, hobbies, contact info.)
- Design: Choose a color scheme, fonts, and layout that reflect your personality and purpose.
- AI Setup: Ensure you have GitHub Copilot or Cursor enabled. Be ready to log AI prompts in a `.prompt/dev_notes.md` file.

## Step 2: Creating the Webpages

Your site should be a multi-page website with consistent navigation.

- Homepage (`index.html`)
	- Title, header, and a short introduction about yourself.
	- Navigation links to other sections (About Me, Resume, Projects, Contact).

- About Me (`about.html`)
	- A detailed biography: background, interests, and goals.
	- A photo of yourself stored in an `/images` subdirectory.

- Resume (`resume.html`)
	- Include your resume or CV with sections like education, experience, skills, and achievements.
	- Embed as formatted HTML, PDF, or an image.

- Projects (`projects.html`)
	- Showcase at least two projects.
	- Include descriptions, screenshots/images, and links to live demos or repositories.

- Contact (`contact.html`)
	- Provide contact info (email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
	- Include a contact form (see Step 4).

## Step 3: Styling and Layout

- Use a separate CSS file (`styles.css`) linked from each HTML page.
- Ensure consistent fonts, colors, and layout across pages.
- Make your site responsive so it works on desktop and mobile.
- Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for structure.
