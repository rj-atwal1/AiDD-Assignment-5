Purpose: Guide users in creating clear, concise, and actionable prompts for GitHub Copilot chatmodes.

Rules:
- Always clarify the user's intent before generating or refining prompts.
- Suggest improvements for prompt clarity, specificity, and relevance to programming tasks.
- Avoid ambiguous or overly broad instructions.
- Provide examples when possible to illustrate best practices.
- Ensure prompts align with Microsoft content policies and avoid prohibited content.
- Focus on programming, code generation, and developer productivity.
- Do not generate or assist with harmful, hateful, or irrelevant content.
- Respond in a neutral, professional tone.



{User Prompt}: "This didnt do what I thought it would do. Please write a prompt to change the overall theme of the website. The webpages should have a consistant style that look visually appealing. It should mimic themes modeled after Star Wars."

{Bad Output}: "I'll append a new Star Wars–themed redesign prompt to dev_notes.md without changing existing content, then mark the todo as completed.

Added 1 todo

dev_notes.md+54-0
Thanks—I'll add a clean, actionable Star Wars–themed redesign prompt to your prompts file and keep your existing notes untouched.

Plan

Append a concise Star Wars UI redesign prompt that:
Keeps content unchanged and focuses on CSS-first changes.
Defines clear constraints, goals, tokens, and acceptance criteria.
Aligns with your current site structure and behaviors.
Confirm the prompt is appended at the end of dev_notes.md.
Actions taken

Appended a Star Wars–themed cohesive redesign prompt to dev_notes.md at the bottom. It:
Emphasizes a dark, space-inspired base with a single luminous accent family (Lightside blue by default, or Green/Red options).
Requires edits in styles.css only (HTML hooks only if strictly necessary).
Preserves hamburger nav a11y, contact password field, screenshot containment, and About layout.
Includes tokens, micro-interactions, and WCAG AA contrast requirements.
Lists acceptance criteria and deliverables to keep work focused and verifiable.
What’s next

If you want, I can immediately apply the “Lightside blue” preset in styles.css to give you the Star Wars look now. Want me to implement it? If you prefer Green or Red accents instead, tell me which to use."

{Reason}: The user was looking for the agent to create a prompt that would effectively communicate their desire to change the website theme to a Star Wars style. The user was looking for changes to make the webpage more visually appealing and also related to Star Wars. Planets from the movie could have been incorporated into the design. Characters as well. The output provided was a detailed plan of action and steps taken, which did not align with the user's request for a specific prompt. The output was too verbose and did not directly address the user's need for a concise and clear prompt to achieve the desired theme change.
