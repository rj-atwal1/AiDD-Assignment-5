Personal website scaffold

This folder contains a simple static website scaffold generated from the assignment instructions.

How to use

- Open `site/index.html` in your browser to preview.
- Replace `site/images/profile-placeholder.png` with your photo (same filename or update HTML).
- Replace `project1-placeholder.png` and `project2-placeholder.png` with your project screenshots.
- Update links in `projects.html` to point to your repositories or live demos.
- The contact form is a front-end placeholder. Wire it to a serverless function or use a form provider to enable submissions.

Files

- `index.html`, `about.html`, `resume.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html` — pages of the site.
- `css/styles.css` — basic responsive styling.
- `images/` — placeholder images to replace.

If you want, I can:

- Add a small build script (Node) to serve locally.
- Convert the site into a single-page React app or a template for GitHub Pages.
- Integrate a simple Netlify / Formspree contact form wiring.
